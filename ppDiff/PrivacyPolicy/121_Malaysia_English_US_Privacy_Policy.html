<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_01">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b></span><br />
<br />
Samsung Electronics collects your personal information in a variety of ways.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Information You Provide Directly</span><br />
<br />
Some Products and Services enable you to give us information directly. For example:<br />
<br />
• When you create an account or profile with us, we may ask for information such as your name, date of birth, or email address.<br />
• If you order a Product or paid Service from us, we may ask for your name, address, contact information, and shipping and payment information to process your order.<br />
• To provide responses when you contact Customer Service, we may need information to identify and authenticate your identify and the Product you’re inquiring about.<br />
• When you communicate with our Customer Service staff or others, your communications will be transmitted through our systems.<br />
• If you share your contacts, we will collect their phone numbers and other contact information to facilitate file sharing and messaging. You can turn off or restrict these features in Settings on your Products.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Information About Your Use of Services</span><br />
<br />
In addition to the information you provide, we will collect information about your use of our Products and Services, such as through software on your Products and by other means. We will collect:<br />
<br />
• Product information: Your hardware model, Product hardware information, IMEI number and other unique device identifiers, phone number, serial number, sales code, access recording, current software version, MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code), MAC address, IP address, Android Advertising ID, cookies, pixels, subscription information, operating system versions, and settings of the Products you use to access Services.<br />
• Log information: Diagnostic, technical, error, and usage information such as the time and duration of your use of Services, search query terms when you enter search terms into your Product in connection with a particular Service, and any information stored in cookies that we have set on your Products.<br />
• Location information: Your Product’s GPS signal or information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services and enable the Location function.<br />
• Voice information: Recordings of your voice that we make and store on our servers when you enable this function and use voice commands to control a Service, or when you contact our Customer Service team. Note that if we work with a third party service provider that provides speech-to-text conversion services on our behalf, this provider may receive and store certain voice commands in accordance with the contract concluded between us and our trusted third-party service provider.<br />
• Samsung Keyboard information: The words that you type when you enable Predictive text. This feature may be offered in connection with your Samsung account to synchronize the data for use on your other Samsung Products. You can clear the data by going to the Predictive text settings.<br />
• Viewing Information: The networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Products and the amount of time spent viewing them.<br />
• Other information about your use of Products and Services, such as the apps you use, the websites you visit, and how you interact with content offered through a Products or Service.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Publicly or Commercially Available or Shared Information</span><br />
<br />
We may receive information about you from publicly or commercially available sources, including such information about you from third party social networking services you use, and combine this with other information about you so that we can better understand your needs, interests, and preferences. We also may receive information about you when other people provide it using our Services, such as your name and contact information when others send a message to you or share files with you.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Other Information We Collect</span><br />
<br />
We may also collect other information about you, your Products, or your use of Services that you consent to send us.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Third Party Analytics</span><br />
<br />
Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected Products over time and across third-party websites, Products, apps and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyze your use of the Services and improve the Services. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services, help administer the Services and diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit 
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a> and 
<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Your Options</span><br />
<br />
You can choose not to provide us with certain types of information, such as information requested as part of registering a Samsung account. In some cases, this may limit your ability to use some Products and Services. We will do our best to explain these limitations when we’re asking for your information so you can make an informed decision. For example, Samsung Cloud allows you to back up your information and create a restore point; however, Samsung Cloud was not designed nor intended to store or process sensitive personal information.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_02">HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION? </b></span><br />
<br />

Your personal information belongs to you. You can ask us to provide details about what we’ve collected, and you can ask us to correct any inaccuracies.

<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_08">WHAT THIRD-PARTY SERVICES DO WE USE? </b></span><br />
<br />
Some of the content, advertising, and functionality in our Services is provided by third parties. These third parties may use cookies, beacons, tracking pixels, and other tools to collect information about your use of these Services. These third parties are not controlled directly by Samsung, so we recommend that you check their privacy policies to understand how they use your data. We also may make available to you certain products or services (e.g., apps available through Galaxy Store or Apps) developed by third parties. Samsung Electronics is not responsible for these third-party products or services.<br />
<br />
If you choose to connect the Services with a social networking service, we may receive and store authentication information from that service to enable you to log in, as well as other information that you allow us to receive. Also, please note that if you choose to connect with a social networking service on a Product used by people in addition to you, those other users may be able to see information stored or displayed in connection with your account on the social networking service(s) with which you connect.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_09">COOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES </b></span><br />
<br />
We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality in our Services, use cookies, pixels, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.<br />
<br />
<em>Cookies</em><br />
Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your Product to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:<br />
• Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you sign in to a service.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they’re spending on the pages. Studying this information helps us to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you’ve seen so you don’t get the same ad each time you access a Service.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties to provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.<br />
<br />
When you use a web browser to access Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Your Product operating system may contain additional cookie controls. Note that some Services are designed to work using cookies, so disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those Services or certain parts of them.<br />
<br />
<em>Other Local Storage</em><br />
We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above. They’re stored on your Products and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your Products from standard cookies, so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, visit 
<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>.<br />
<br />
<em>Beacons</em><br />
We, along with certain third parties, may use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your Product to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your Product, know when you’ve viewed particular content or a particular email message, and determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon and the IP address of your Product. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and, along with cookies, to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.<br />

<strong>SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY – SMART TV SUPPLEMENT</strong><br />
<br />
Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the Products connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.<br />
<br />
The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.<br />
<br />
In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience. We base these recommendations and additional services on:<br />
• Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other Products (About the TV viewing information please see ‘<em>Viewing Information Services</em>’ section below);<br />
• Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;<br />
• Information about your clicks on the “Like”, “Dislike”, “Watch Now”, and other buttons on your Smart TV;<br />
• The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;<br />
• Other Smart TV usage and Product information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.<br />
<br />
<em>Viewing Information Services</em><br />
This privacy notice should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy, which also applies to your receipt of customized Smart TV experiences and can be found at 
<a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp" target="_blank">https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp</a>.<br />
In order to provide you with customized Smart TV experiences, some of our features and services will rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information.<br />
Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them.<br />
We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. Your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information in order to determine the programs watched.<br />
You may change your privacy choice at any time by going to the settings menu to disable the particular feature or service at your sole discretion, in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be collected for that particular feature or service.<br />
<br />
Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information outside of Malaysia to the Republic of Korea, consistent with this policy. In addition, your use of the Services may also involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the European Economic Area, the United States of America, and Canada. <br />
<br />
Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. We will take appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable law, to ensure that your personal information remains protected. <br />
<br />
<table class="auto-style2" style="width: 80%">

For more information, or to obtain a copy of the contractual agreements in place, please contact us at our Privacy Support Page (<a href="https://www.samsung.com/request-desk" target="_blank">https://www.samsung.com/request-desk</a>).<br />
<br />
Bear in mind, that your privacy choice may affect the availability or quality of the specific viewing information based service.</td>

<br />
<em>Interest-Based Advertisement Services</em><br />
The Interest-Based Advertisement Services (the “IBA Services”) is designed to provide the ability to obtain and view useful, interactive, and interest based advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third party platforms or Products, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.<br />
<br />
In order to make the advertising on your Products more relevant to you, the IBA service will rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.<br />
<br />
Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these groups for the IBA Service. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and thus, which advertisements your Products receive.<br />
<br />
You may disable the IBA Service at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV.<br />
<br />
Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Service will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location and other estimated or inferred information. They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information about the IBA Services, please refer to the IBA Services Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.<br />
<br />
<em>PSID</em><br />
Your Smart TV viewing history and usage information collected for the purposes of providing interest based advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the Personalized Service ID or “PSID”.<br />
<br />
You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Smart TV and, once reset, your Smart TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest based advertisements will be de-linked from its previous PSID. Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and interest based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.<br />
<br />
<em>Voice Recognition</em><br />
You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.<br />
<br />
If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide the Voice Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your Product, including Product identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice Recognition features. In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your voice commands when you make a specific request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen or by speaking a wake word (e.g. “Hi, Bixby”) and speaking into the microphone on the remote control or Smart TV.<br />
<br />
If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.<br />
<br />
You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu. However, this would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features.<br />
