We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices with respect to the Services or changes in applicable law.

<b id="pp_01">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? </b></span><br />
<br />
Samsung Electronics collects your personal information in a variety of ways.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Information You Provide Directly</span><br />
<br />
Some Services enable you to give us information directly. For example:<br />
<br />
• When you create an account or profile with us, we may ask for information such as your name, date of birth, or email address.<br />
• If you order a product or paid service from us, we may ask for your name, address, contact information, and shipping and payment information to process your order.<br />
• To provide responses when you contact Customer Service, we may need information to verify your identify and the product you’re inquiring about.<br />
• When you communicate with our Customer Service staff or others, your communications will be transmitted through our systems.<br />
• If you share your contacts, we’ll collect their phone numbers and other contact information to facilitate file sharing and messaging. You can turn off or restrict these features in Settings on your devices.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Information About Your Use of Services</span><br />
<br />
In addition to the information you provide, we will collect information about your use of our Services through software on your devices and by other means. We will collect:<br />
<br />
• Device information: Your hardware model, device hardware information, IMEI number and other unique device identifiers, phone number, serial number, sales code, access recording, current software version, MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code), MAC address, IP address, cookies, pixels, subscription information, operating system versions, and settings of the devices you use to access Services.<br />
• Log information: Diagnostic, technical, error, and usage information such as the time and duration of your use of Services, search query terms when you enter search terms into your device in connection with a particular Samsung Service, and any information stored in cookies that we have set on your devices.<br />
• Location information: Your device’s GPS signal or information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services and enable the Location function.<br />
• Voice information: Recordings of your voice that we make and store on our servers when you enable this function and use voice commands to control a Service, or when you contact our Customer Service team. Note that if we work with a third party service provider that provides speech-to-text conversion services on our behalf, this provider may receive and store certain voice commands in accordance with the contract concluded between us and our trusted third-party service provider. Turkish language is not supported.<br />
• Samsung Keyboard information: The words that you type when you enable Predictive text. This feature may be offered in connection with your Samsung account to synchronize the data for use on your other Samsung mobile devices. You can clear the data by going to the Predictive text settings.<br />

<br />
We sometimes gather publicly or commercially available information, including information from social networks you use, and combine this with other information about you so that we can better understand your needs, interests, and preferences. We also sometimes gather information about you when other people provide it using our Services, such as your name and contact information when others send a message to you or share files with you.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Other Information We Collect</span><br />
<br />
We may also collect other information about you, your devices, or your use of Services that you consent to send us.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Third Party Analytics</span><br />
<br />
Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyze your use of the Services and improve the Services. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services, help administer the Services and diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit 
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a> and

<br />
<span class="auto-style1">Your Options</span><br />
<br />
You can choose not to provide us with certain types of information, such as information requested as part of registering a Samsung account. In some cases, this may limit your ability to use some Services. We’ll do our best to explain these limitations when we’re asking for your information so you can make an informed decision. For example, Samsung Cloud allows you to back up your information and create a restore point; however, Samsung Cloud was not designed nor intended to store or process sensitive information.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_02">HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION? </b></span><br />

<br />
We will also disclose your information to the following entities, only to the extent that this will be necessary to provide our Services:<br />
<br />

These providers are also committed to protecting your information.<br />
• Other Parties when Required by Law or as Necessary to Protect Our Services: For example, it may be necessary by law, legal process, or court order from governmental authorities to disclose your information. They may also seek your information from us for the purposes of law enforcement, national security, anti-terrorism, or other issues that are related to public security.<br />
• Other Parties in Connection with Corporate Transactions: We may disclose your information to a third party as part of a merger or transfer, acquisition or sale, or in the event of a bankruptcy.<br />
• Other Parties with Your Consent or at Your Direction: In addition to the disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties when you separately consent to or request such sharing.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_04">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE? </b></span><br />
<br />
We take data protection seriously. We’ve put in place physical and technical safeguards to keep the information we collect secure. However, please note that although we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_05">WHERE DO WE SEND YOUR DATA? </b></span><br />
<br />
Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information within and outside of your country of residence, consistent with this policy. In particular, your personal information will be transferred to the Republic of Korea. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_06">CONSENT TO INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF DATA </b></span><br />
<br />
By using or participating in any Service and/or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage and processing of your information outside of your country of residence (e.g., South Korea), consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_07">WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS? </b></span><br />
<br />
Your personal information belongs to you. You can ask us to provide details about what we’ve collected, and you can ask us to delete it or correct any inaccuracies. If permitted by law, We may charge you a small fee for providing you with this ability. You can also ask us to restrict or limit processing, sharing, or transfer of your personal information, as well as to provide to you your personal information that we’ve collected so you can use it for your own purposes. However, requesting the deletion of your personal information may also result in a loss of access to Services we provide. We won’t delete data that we’re required by law to retain. In addition, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.<br />
<br />
To make a request concerning your rights or to make an inquiry, contact us. See the <a href="#pp_11">CONTACT US</a> section.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_08">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? </b></span><br />
<br />
We won’t keep your personal information for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. This means that information will be destroyed or erased from our systems when it’s no longer required.<br />
<br />
We take appropriate steps to ensure that we process and retain information about you based on the following logic:<br />
<br />
1. At least the duration for which the information is used to provide you with a service <br />
2. As required under law, a contract, or with regard to our statutory obligations<br />

<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_09">WHAT THIRD-PARTY SERVICES DO WE USE? </b></span><br />
<br />
Some of the content, advertising, and functionality in our Services is provided by third parties. These third parties may use cookies, beacons, tracking pixels, and other tools to collect information about your use of these Services. These third parties are not controlled directly by Samsung, so we recommend that you check their privacy policies to understand how they use your data. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by websites, mobile applications or other services. You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.<br />
<br />
For some apps and services, including social networks, we receive and store sign-in information, as well as other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these apps and services.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<b id="pp_10">COOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES </b></span><br />
<br />
We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality in our Services, use cookies, pixels, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.<br />
<br />
<em>Cookies</em><br />
Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:<br />
• Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you sign in to a service.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they’re spending on the pages. Studying this information helps us to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you’ve seen so you don’t get the same ad each time you access a Service.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties to provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.<br />
<br />
When you use a web browser to access Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Your device operating system may contain additional cookie controls. Note that some Services are designed to work using cookies, so disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those Services or certain parts of them.<br />
<br />
<em>Other Local Storage</em><br />
We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above. They’re stored on your devices and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your devices from standard cookies, so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, visit 
<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>.<br />
<br />
<em>Beacons</em><br />
We, along with certain third parties, may use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you’ve viewed particular content or a particular email message, and determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon and the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and, along with cookies, to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.<br />
By accessing and using our Services, you consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on your devices. You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and information by us and by the third parties mentioned above.<br />

<strong>SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY – SMART TV SUPPLEMENT<br />
</strong>
<br />
Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.<br />
<br />
The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.<br />
In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience. We base these recommendations and additional services on:<br />
• Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices (About the TV viewing information please see ‘Viewing Information Services’ section below);<br />
• Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;<br />
• Information about your clicks on the “Like”, “Dislike”, “Watch Now”, and other buttons on your Smart TV;<br />
• The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;<br />
• Other Smart TV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.<br />
<br />
<em>Viewing Information Services</em><br />
This privacy notice should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy, which also applies to your receipt of customized Smart TV experiences and can be found at 
<a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp" target="_blank">https://account.samsung.com/membership/pp</a>.<br />
In order to provide you with customized Smart TV experiences, some of our features and services will rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information.<br />
Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them.<br />
We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. Your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information in order to determine the programs watched.<br />
You may change your privacy choice at any time by going to the settings menu to disable the particular feature or service at your sole discretion, in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be collected for that particular feature or service.<br />
<br />
<em>Interest-Based Advertisement Services</em><br />
The Interest-Based Advertisement Services (the “IBA Services”) is designed to provide the ability to obtain and view useful, interactive, and interest based advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third party platforms or devices, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.<br />
<br />
In order to make the advertising on your devices more relevant to you, the IBA service will rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.<br />
<br />
Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these groups for the IBA Service. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and thus, which advertisements your devices receive.<br />
<br />
You may disable the IBA Service at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV.<br />
<br />
Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Service will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location and other estimated or inferred information. They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information about the IBA Services, please refer to the IBA Services Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.<br />
<br />
<em>PSID</em><br />
Your Smart TV viewing history and usage information collected for the purposes of providing interest based advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the Personalized Service ID or “PSID”.<br />
You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Smart TV and, once reset, your Smart TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest based advertisements will be de-linked from its previous PSID. Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and interest based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.<br />
<br />
<em>Voice Recognition</em><br />
You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands. Turkish language is not supported.<br />
<br />
If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide the Voice Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice Recognition features. In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your voice commands when you make a specific request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen or by speaking a wake word (e.g. “Hi, Bixby”) and speaking into the microphone on the remote control or Smart TV.<br />
If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.<br />
You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu. However, this would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information about the Voice Recognition, please refer to the Voice Recognition Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.<br />
<br />
<em>Third Parties</em><br />
Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g. its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g. your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third party websites and services you use.<br />
<br />
<em>Country-Specific Features</em><br />
Please note that one or more of the features described in this Smart TV Supplement may not be available to you depending on where you live.<br />
<br />
<br />

Samsung mobile devices, wearables and other related technologies and services (collectively, our “Mobile Devices”) offer a wide range of features including those allowing users to monitor and improve their fitness and well-being, improve their user experience, make mobile payments and control their Mobile Devices with voice commands. When you use our Mobile Devices we collect, use, share and store your information in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about how we use that information to provide our Mobile Device features.<br />
<br />
<em>Standard Information about your Mobile Device</em><br />
When you activate your Mobile Device or use its internet connected features, information is collected. This includes information about your Mobile Device, such as your IP address, OS version, regional and language settings, and IMEIs and other unique device identifiers. It also includes information about how, when and for how long you use your Mobile Device.<br />
As described in the Privacy Policy, we use standard information about your Mobile Device for operation, maintenance, and improvement purposes and may share standard information about your Mobile Device with business partners such as your wireless carriers, or with service providers that provide services on our behalf.<br />
<br />
<em>Third Parties</em><br />
Please note that when you use a feature provided by a third-party, including your wireless carrier, that provider may collect or receive information about your Mobile Device (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g., your request to buy or rent the content), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.<br />
<br />
<em>Specific Features</em><br />
Please note that one or more of the features described in this Supplement may not be available to you depending on your model version, your service provider or where you live.<br />
<br />
<em>Samsung Health</em><br />
The Samsung Health application, connected applications and associated accessories (collectively “Samsung Health”) is an all-in-one companion designed to encourage a healthy lifestyle. With Samsung Health, you can track your everyday activities; get coaching to reach your daily fitness goals and milestones; and measure and manage factors such as your heart rate, SpO2 levels, and stress level.<br />
The purpose of processing data for Samsung Health is to provide the service or feature that you request, including data back-up and sync services for Samsung account users, to provide data analysis and statistics to enhance your wellness and to improve Samsung Health itself and its offerings. Data can be collected either through sensors on your Mobile Device or when you actually enter your own data into the applicable Mobile Device or related application or accessory.<br />
Further information on the way we process your information is described in the Samsung Health Privacy Notice, viewable in the Settings menu of the Samsung Health application.<br />
<br />
<em>Samsung Social</em><br />
Samsung Social (formerly named Enhanced Features) is a bundled set of services designed to simplify and improve the ways in which you can share and connect with your friends. <br />
With the currently available features for example, you can share your profile and view images from your friends; and easily share files and contents with your friends in Contact.<br />
To provide these features, we will need to collect your name, phone number information from your contacts list and access to contents you are about to share with your friends.<br />
You have the choice to disable these features in its entirety, or in the alternative, you can pick and choose which of the services you wish to use, by visiting your Samsung Account Settings in Mobile device or the applications which use Samsung Social features.<br />

<br />
<em>Voice Services</em><br />
You can control your Mobile Device, and use many of its features, with voice commands depending on the language you select and your country.<br />
Depending on your model and region you can command your Mobile Device to activate certain features such as playing songs from playlist or perform web searches using S Voice. Further, you can control everything you’ve done with touch interface using your voice command with Bixby. You can also receive language translation support through S Translator, dictate memos through Voice Memo or activate features while driving by speaking to your Mobile Device after enabling Car Mode.<br />
To provide the Voice Services, some voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device and its usage, including device identifiers) to a third-party service provider that converts your voice commands to text.

Information about your mobile device usage that is collected for the purposes of providing customised marketing will be linked to a randomised, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the Samsung advertising ID. You may reset your Samsung advertising ID at any time via the Settings menu on your mobile device and your previous usage information with respect to customised marketing will be de-linked and separated from what is collected under the new Samsung advertising ID. However, if you reset your Samsung advertising ID, the customised marketing may not be best aligned to your personal interests. You may also opt out from receiving customised marketing at any time via the Settings menu in the applicable Samsung service application on your mobile device.<br />
However, even if you opt out from receiving customised marketing, it will not affect whether or not you receive other types of ads and marketing on your mobile devices. The only difference will be that those ads will not be based on the usage information of your mobile device.<br />
